Trapping Rain Water

Given an array arr[] with non-negative integers representing the height of blocks. If the width of each block is 1, compute how much water can be trapped between the blocks during the rainy season. 

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [3, 0, 1, 0, 4, 0 2]
Output: 10
Explanation: Total water trapped = 0 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10 units.
